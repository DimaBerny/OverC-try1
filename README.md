## Description / vision
Two players (online) are trying their best to create food. In order to complete the tasks, SYNERGY is the most important skill. E.g., to create a burger, you need to cut the tomato, salad, and meat, then fry the meat and put it into the buns in the correct order, all within a time limit.

The main point of this project is to learn how to create multiplayer in Unity, so that the host and client can work properly, and everything that happens will be displayed on BOTH screens. C# scripts will be used.
